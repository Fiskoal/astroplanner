# Skymap api notes & documentation
Unfortunately, a lot of this ended up not being used because of SkyMap server errors.<br>
This markdown file is for notes and documentation in relation to and use of the skymap api.<br>
Anyone feel free to reference it, I know I will. <br>**Heavily.**

## Quick reference, important definitions 

 ### Right Ascension
 Right ascension is the ***angular distance*** of a particular point measured eastward along the ***celestial equator*** from the sun at the ***Spring Equinox*** (aka Vernal or March Equinox) to the point in question above the Earth.
 > #### Breakdown
 > Right ascension is the distance (in degrees and/or time, SKYMAP API uses degrees) between the where the Sun is during the Vernal Equinox (in relation to the Earth), and the point in question.<br>
 > Note that 24 hours is equal to 360 degrees.

 ### Declination
 Declination is the angular distance of a point north or south of the celestial equator.
 > #### Breakdown
 > Vertical angle (north and south) between point of reference and the celestial equator.

 ### Angular size of celestial sphere / square (aka angular diameter, apparent diameter, or apparent size)
 The angle between two opposite points of a celesial object, from outside to outside.<br>
 > **this is my breakdown, theres no google  definition of it**

 ### Visual Magnitude
 The measure of brightness of a star or other astronomical object observed from Earth.<br>
 > **doesn't need a breakdown**

### Visual stimuli
